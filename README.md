🚀 OpenGL Renderer

✨ Overview

Welcome to the OpenGL Renderer! This project provides a powerful and flexible foundation for rendering 3D graphics using modern OpenGL. Whether you're building games, simulations, or visual tools, this renderer is designed to be a clear, efficient, and extensible starting point. Dive into the world of real-time 3D rendering with ease!

🌟 Features

Custom Shader Support: Load and compile your own vertex and fragment shaders for complete control over rendering. 🖌️

(tbi)Basic Scene Management: Organize 3D objects, lights, and cameras within a simple scene graph. 🌳

(tbi)Camera Controls: Implement intuitive camera movement (e.g., first-person, orbiting) for exploration. 🕹️

(tbi)Texture Mapping: Apply images to your 3D models for realistic visuals. 🖼️

(tbi)Model Loading: Support for common 3D model formats (e.g., OBJ) to bring your assets to life. 📦

(tbi)Lighting Models: Implement various lighting techniques (e.g., Phong, Blinn-Phong) for dynamic illumination. 💡

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Built with portability in mind (depending on specific library choices like GLFW, GLEW/GLAD). 🌍
